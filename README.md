# water-leakage-detection-system
## Overview
This project is an Arduino-based water leakage detection system.
It continuously monitors water presence using a leakage sensor and
alerts the user by blinking an LED when leakage is detected.

## Features
- Real-time water leakage detection
- LED alert system
- Adjustable threshold value
- Simple and low-cost hardware

## Components Used
- Arduino / ESP8266
- Water leakage sensor
- LED
- Resistors
- Jumper wires

## Working Principle
1. The sensor reads water presence.
2. Sensor value is compared with a threshold.
3. If leakage is detected:
   - LED blinks continuously
4. If no leakage:
   - LED remains OFF

## Applications
- Home plumbing monitoring
- Smart water management
- Industrial leakage detection

## Future Improvements
- Buzzer alert
- Mobile app notification
- IoT cloud dashboard
